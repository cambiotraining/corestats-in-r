## Purpose and aim
A two-way analysis of variance is used when we have two categorical predictor variables (or factors) and a single continuous response variable. For example, when we are looking at how body weight (continuous response variable in kilograms) is affected by gender (categorical variable, Male or Female) and exercise type (categorical variable, Control or Runner).
