However, representation obscures fact paired data. really need look difference leg length deer:gives us much clearer picture. looks though hindlegs 4 cm longer forelegs, average. also suggests leg differences might normally distributed (data look bit skewed).5.

Perform paired Wilcoxon testThe paired Wilcoxon test makes assumptions order data paired t-test. significant difference.7. Check assumptionsWe need consider distribution difference leg lengths rather individual distributions.Shapiro-Wilk test Q-Q plot suggest difference data aren’t normally distributed, rules paired t-test. therefore consider paired Wilcoxon test next.
