Import Data, Summarise visualiseI always recommend storing data stacked format even example, even though case might seem easier store data unstacked format (pretty much time even sensible option). example manually input data excel following layout:ordering data important ; first hindleg row corresponds first foreleg row, second second . indicate use id column, observation unique ID.Let‚Äôs look data see can see.looks though might difference legs, hindlegs longer forelegs. However, representation obscures fact paired data. really need look difference leg length deer:gives us much clearer picture. looks though hindlegs 4 cm longer forelegs, average. also suggests leg differences might normally distributed (data look bit skewed).5. Perform two-sample t-testThe paired t-test assumes data stored exactly entered (.e.¬†first hindleg row matches first foreleg row). apparently see significant difference.6. Perform paired Wilcoxon testThe paired Wilcoxon test makes assumptions order data paired t-test. significant difference.7. Check assumptionsWe need consider distribution difference leg lengths rather individual distributions.Shapiro-Wilk test Q-Q plot suggest difference data aren‚Äôt normally distributed, rules paired t-test. therefore consider paired Wilcoxon test next. Remember test requires distribution differences symmetric, whereas box-plot suggested data much skewed.8. ConclusionsSo, frustratingly, neither tests appropriate dataset. differences fore- hind leg lengths neither normal enough paired t-test symmetric enough Wilcoxon test don‚Äôt enough data just use t-test (‚Äôd need 30 points ). situation? Well answer aren‚Äôt actually traditional statistical tests valid dataset stands!two options available someone:try transforming raw data (take logs, square root, reciprocals) hope one leads modified dataset satisfies assumptions one tests ‚Äôve covered, oruse permutation test approach (work beyond scope course).reason included example first practical purely illustrate simple dataset apparently clear message (leg lengths differ within deer) can intractable. don‚Äôt need complex datasets go beyond capabilities classical statistics.Jeremy Clarkson put :bombshell, ‚Äôs time end.
