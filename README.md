# CoreStats in R

These materials are to support the CoreStats in R courses that are run by the Bioinformatics Training Facility, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

The materials are free to use, but may not be reproduced or sold for commercial purposes without consent.

Feedback on the materials are greatly appreciated and best raised via `Issues` on GitHub.

The course materials were originally developed by Dr. Matt Castle and have been further developed by Dr. Martin van Rongen.


The style of the materials is based on the [Project Light](https://www.cam.ac.uk/web-support/project-light) template system of the University of Cambridge. The materials themselves are generated with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org), which has been integrated into the styles templates.
